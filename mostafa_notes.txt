- there's some images with icon and it's descriptive text, though that causes
    . specific text widgets in some screens
    . impossible to change font, color or even text size

- it's better to use png icons with transparent background instead of white,
    so you will be able to change icon color anytime.

- admin page is hard coded and includes a lot of repeated code for each grid item
    and dose not use a [GridView], it depends on [Row]s & [Column] which is inefficient
    the application is not working in landscape mode
